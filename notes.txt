BA ID
The digital identity system for citizens and visitors of Buenos Aires City.



Government is evolving
As an open-by-default city, Buenos Aires provides digital services to 15 million users every year.
BA ID will allow our users to interact with the City Administration in a smarter and simpler way.


Mi BA dashboard
Users will find the information and tools to get the most of the city in one place.
Online procedures
Health appointments
Job applications
Social benefits


Open technology
BA ID uses OpenID Connect, aiming at connecting our city with other cities or with our national government.
It will be an ID provider for 3rd party websites, so anyone can use our Public API to verify their users.
We request minimum information to create an account that can be edited, erased or downloaded as a dataset.
